            <h2> Who am I?</h2>
            <P> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Ha'upei! My name is Sebas, I'm 18 years old and I'm a student at RVCC going for the Computer Science Major. I'm from CDE, Paraguay, a city that shares borders with Brazil and Argentina (pretty cool huh). I moved to the United States in 2017, I was 12 and I very excited for the new adventure. I lived in the Bronx (NY) for a year and a half, then I moved to Raritan, NJ. I speak 4 languages, them being Spanish, Guarani, English, and Portuguese. I have been to many countries like Brazil, Argentina, Panama, Paraguay and the US. I like to go out a lot, hang out with my friends, listen and jam to most types of music and more. I like to play videogames, read books, and watch movies. I would also like to say that I like style, so everytime I go out I take a lot of time deciding what my outfit is going to be and always try to rock something new!. I chose Computer Science as a major because I have always been interested in technology. Ever since I was a kid I would play a lot of videogames, and play with computers. I also have a very big interest in music, I would like to learn more in the future and hopefully become a music producer in the future. The fact that I like more about technology is that it is currently evolving, so there will always be something new everyday that will help us in many different ways. I hope you found this website fun, for me it was a new experience and would definitely like to do more websites!.  </P>

            <h2>Paragraphs from Evelina</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Almost instantly the whole truth of the transaction seemed to rush upon her mind, and her wrath was inconceivably violent. She asked me a thousand questions in a breath; but, fortunately, was too vehement to attend to my embarrassment, which must otherwise have betrayed my knowledge of the deceit. Revenge was her first wish; and she vowed she would go the next morning to Justice Fielding, and inquire what punishment she might lawfully inflict upon the Captain for his assault.</p>

                <p>I believe we were an hour at Bishopsgate Street before poor Madame Duval could allow any thing to be mentioned but her own story; at any length, however, Mr. Branghton told her, that M. Du Bois, and all his own family, were waiting for her at his house. A hackney-coach was then called, and we proceeded to Snow Hill.</p>
                
                <p>Mr. Branghton's house is small and inconvenient; though his shop, which takes in all the ground floor, is large and commodious. I believe I told you before, that he is a silver-smith.</p>
                
                <p>We were conducted up two pairs of stairs: for the dining-room, Mr. Branghton told us, was let. His two daughters, their brother, M. Du Bois, and a young man, were at tea. They had waited some time for Madame Duval, but I found they had not any expectation that I should accompany her; and the young ladies, I believe, were rather more surprised than pleased when I made my appearance; for they seemed hurt that I should see their apartment. Indeed, I would willingly have saved them that pain, had it been in my power.</p>
                
                <p>The first person who saw me was M. Du Bois, "Ah, mon Dieu!" exclaimed he, "voila Mademoiselle!"</p>
                
                <p>"Goodness," cried young Branghton, "if there isn't Miss!"</p>
                
                <p>"Lord, so there is!" said Miss Polly; "well, I'm sure I should never have dreamed of Miss's coming."</p>
                
                <p>"Nor I neither, I'm sure," cried Miss Branghton, "or else I would not have been in this room to see her: I'm quite ashamed about it;-only not thinking of seeing any body but my aunt-however, Tom, it's all your fault; for, you know very well I wanted to borrow Mr. Smith's room, only you were so grumpy you would not let me."</p>
                
                <p>"Lord, what signifies?" said her brother; "I dare be sworn Miss has been up two pair of stairs before now;-ha'n't you, Miss?"</p>
                
                <p>I begged that I might not give them the least disturbance; and assured them that I had not any choice in regard to what room we sat in.</p>
                <p>"Well," said Miss Polly, "when you come next, Miss, we'll have Mr. Smith's room: and it's a very pretty one, and only up one pair of stairs, and nicely furnished, and every thing."</p>

                 <p>"To say the truth," said Miss Branghton, "I thought that my cousin would not, upon any account, have come to town in the summer-time; for it's not at all the fashion ;-so, to be sure, thinks I, she'll stay till September, when the play-houses open."</p>

                <p>This was my reception, which I believe you will not call a very cordial one. Madame Duval, who, after having severely reprimanded M. Du Bois for his negligence, was just entering upon the story of her misfortunes, now wholly engaged the company.</p>

        <h2>CSS Animation</h2>


       <!--<div class="smily">
           <div class="eyes"></div>
           <div class="lips"></div>
        </div>-->
        
        <div id="blog">
        <div class="happy-container">
        <div class="smily">
         <div class="eyes"></div>
        <div class="lips"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
    
        
        <p>CSS animation is a fun way of creating art, it is one of the lessons I learned during class.
             There are many things you can create using css with all the features it offers. 
            CSS animation allows elements to gradually change from one style to another. Like previously mentioned, 
            there are many properties that you can use at the same time which is very cool. 
            For my animation, I chose a smiley face done purely in css! I did this by first creating different divs, 
            each with their own class containing their respective name and content.
        </p>
        
        <img src="img/smily-facedivs.png" alt="my divs for the smiley face">

       <p>After doing that, most of the work will be done in CSS, where things get tricky. 
        I worked on separate categories for each part of the smiley face.
         The first div with the class smiley hold all the other parts of the face, the eyes and lips.
        </p>

        <!--Space for when smiley is fixed correctly-->

        <p>After being done with doing the face, I went ahead and added the eyes and lips part. 
            For each, there are going to be two steps, one state being before the user hovers on the smiley face,
             and one state that is after the user hovers over it </p>

        <img src="img/eyes-before-after.png" alt="code for the eyes in y smily face">

        <p>The :: (before and after) help create a pseudo element which is the first child of the element, in this case the eyes.
            As seen above, I used them to determine the state of the element before and after.</p>

        <p>Next, I set the eyes positions for before and after, and put them in a selector with the smiley div</p>

        <img src="img/eyes-combined-with-smiley.png" alt="the eyes div and smiles div put together in a selector" width="400" height="270">

        <p>Next, I added the lips, and gave it some properties like I did to the eyes and face </p>

        <img src="img/lips-for-smiley.png" alt="the code for making the lips for my smiley face">

        <p>I also added a hover effect to the lips, which will make it smile when it's hovered on.
            I also added a @keyframe tag, which is an important part of CSS animation.
             Keyframes sets properties that happens in a animation depending on what time frame you set it to.
             This helps anyone that wants to make CSS animation have more control on the animation's process.</p>
