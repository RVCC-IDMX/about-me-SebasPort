            <h2> Who am I?</h2>
            <P> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Ha'upei! My name is Sebas, I'm 18 years old and I'm a student at RVCC going for the Computer Science Major. I'm from CDE, Paraguay, a city that shares borders with Brazil and Argentina (pretty cool huh). I moved to the United States in 2017, I was 12 and I very excited for the new adventure. I lived in the Bronx (NY) for a year and a half, then I moved to Raritan, NJ. I speak 4 languages, them being Spanish, Guarani, English, and Portuguese. I have been to many countries like Brazil, Argentina, Panama, Paraguay and the US. I like to go out a lot, hang out with my friends, listen and jam to most types of music and more. I like to play videogames, read books, and watch movies. I would also like to say that I like style, so everytime I go out I take a lot of time deciding what my outfit is going to be and always try to rock something new!. I chose Computer Science as a major because I have always been interested in technology. Ever since I was a kid I would play a lot of videogames, and play with computers. I also have a very big interest in music, I would like to learn more in the future and hopefully become a music producer in the future. The fact that I like more about technology is that it is currently evolving, so there will always be something new everyday that will help us in many different ways. I hope you found this website fun, for me it was a new experience and would definitely like to do more websites!.  </P>

            <h2>Paragraphs from Evelina</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Almost instantly the whole truth of the transaction seemed to rush upon her mind, and her wrath was inconceivably violent. She asked me a thousand questions in a breath; but, fortunately, was too vehement to attend to my embarrassment, which must otherwise have betrayed my knowledge of the deceit. Revenge was her first wish; and she vowed she would go the next morning to Justice Fielding, and inquire what punishment she might lawfully inflict upon the Captain for his assault.</p>

                <p>I believe we were an hour at Bishopsgate Street before poor Madame Duval could allow any thing to be mentioned but her own story; at any length, however, Mr. Branghton told her, that M. Du Bois, and all his own family, were waiting for her at his house. A hackney-coach was then called, and we proceeded to Snow Hill.</p>
                
                <p>Mr. Branghton's house is small and inconvenient; though his shop, which takes in all the ground floor, is large and commodious. I believe I told you before, that he is a silver-smith.</p>
                
                <p>We were conducted up two pairs of stairs: for the dining-room, Mr. Branghton told us, was let. His two daughters, their brother, M. Du Bois, and a young man, were at tea. They had waited some time for Madame Duval, but I found they had not any expectation that I should accompany her; and the young ladies, I believe, were rather more surprised than pleased when I made my appearance; for they seemed hurt that I should see their apartment. Indeed, I would willingly have saved them that pain, had it been in my power.</p>
                
                <p>The first person who saw me was M. Du Bois, "Ah, mon Dieu!" exclaimed he, "voila Mademoiselle!"</p>
                
                <p>"Goodness," cried young Branghton, "if there isn't Miss!"</p>
                
                <p>"Lord, so there is!" said Miss Polly; "well, I'm sure I should never have dreamed of Miss's coming."</p>
                
                <p>"Nor I neither, I'm sure," cried Miss Branghton, "or else I would not have been in this room to see her: I'm quite ashamed about it;-only not thinking of seeing any body but my aunt-however, Tom, it's all your fault; for, you know very well I wanted to borrow Mr. Smith's room, only you were so grumpy you would not let me."</p>
                
                <p>"Lord, what signifies?" said her brother; "I dare be sworn Miss has been up two pair of stairs before now;-ha'n't you, Miss?"</p>
                
                <p>I begged that I might not give them the least disturbance; and assured them that I had not any choice in regard to what room we sat in.</p>
                <p>"Well," said Miss Polly, "when you come next, Miss, we'll have Mr. Smith's room: and it's a very pretty one, and only up one pair of stairs, and nicely furnished, and every thing."</p>

                 <p>"To say the truth," said Miss Branghton, "I thought that my cousin would not, upon any account, have come to town in the summer-time; for it's not at all the fashion ;-so, to be sure, thinks I, she'll stay till September, when the play-houses open."</p>

                <p>This was my reception, which I believe you will not call a very cordial one. Madame Duval, who, after having severely reprimanded M. Du Bois for his negligence, was just entering upon the story of her misfortunes, now wholly engaged the company.</p>
