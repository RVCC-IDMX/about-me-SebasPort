### Purpose 
        The purpose of this project was to explore and expand my web development abilities.  It is also meant to share what we are as a person, things such as our hobbies, pictures and interests.I am new to this whole computer programming world and I am eager to learn everything there is to know. For each part of this about me I have learned new tools, skills and ways of making a website look better.(All of the skills and tools mentioned below have been applied throughout this project). Some of the skills I have learned are first, to create a website you need a program like VScode, creating a file with a index.html name, for customizing your page you could use a style.css fyle and much more.  I've learned that everything you want to show or put on your website needs to be inside an anchor "<" and its corresponding attribute/selector. I have learned how to do some text bigger that others, like the h1, h2, h3 feature. For normal text you can use the "p" atribute, which will grab anything inside it and show it on the website. Another thing you can do is divide the content by sections, and you can give names to these sections by addind the "id" feature. If you would like to further divide down sections you can add the "div" feature".Some of the skills that I learned in this project was how to instert images, using the img src command (which I used to insert images in my gallery section). You can also add links with the a a or link href. I have used the second option to insert/embed fonts for my text. I have also used some border properties, which give a border to a section, and you can personalize it such as setting its color, size, and if you want a radius. I have also learned how to make a list with either the ol or ul properties, which will put items in either numbered or dotted list. Another big skill I have learned is adding media states, which depending on what screen-size you set it, it will resize the page for it to be able to be readable. I have also learned how to add videos in my website, which you can do by adding an iframe tag and set width and height for it. In the iframe tag you can also change and tweak the autplay feature, accelerometer, gyroscope and much more. I have also learned how to add a contact form, which includes a lot of features such as a space for adding text, where visitors can add their names, email, phone number, phone type and and optional message, the option for a multiple choice buttom, and a submit buttom which will send you their notifications. For required sections, I put "required" inside the input anchors. For comments in the index.html, you can add them by texting  something between the following "<!--comment-->". You can also add this in the style.ccs part of any project by simply texting /*comment*/. I have learned that every picture posted needs an alt attribute with a description of what the picture is. I have also learned that the colors you pick for your website need to be carefully chosen, since there is people that can suffer from visual problems, so you need to pick one that everyone with visual problems can distinguish.

### Color Wheel
For my colors, I went with this:
-#0000 (black)
-#823b00 (brown)
-#F3D4B8 (light Beige)
